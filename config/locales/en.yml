  homepage_body: "
    Following the great tradition of <a href=\"http://barcamp.org/BarCampAlsace\">BarCampAlsace</a>, we're now setting up a new \"venture\": BarCampEurodistrict.
    <br/>
    This year, BarCampEurodistrict will happen <strong>saturday 20th of november 2010</strong>, during the <a href=\"http://www.strasbourg.eu/see\">European entrepreneur week</a>, in coordination with the City of Strasbourg and the WRO.

    <br/>
    That's why this event will be an International BarCamp. It means that the spoken language will be the least common denominator among sessions participants: before beginning a session, ask (in english) if everybody in the room can understand you :) It could be French, German, English or maybe Klingon!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Starting at 9AM, we'll welcome you with a warm cup of coffee and some croissants at the CPPlex, the first corworking space in Strasbourg, <strong>17 rue des magasins, 67000 Strasbourg, France</strong>. The sessions will begin at 10AM and end at 7PM.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have any questions, contact Yann Klis (yann [point] klis [at] gmail [point] com or on twitter @yannski) or ping #barcampeurodsitrict on Twitter.
